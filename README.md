This Construction Management python code takes into account multiple variables and conditons to create cost estimate ranges for the cost of construction for a building. 

The variables include the type of building:
    (Residential, Commercial and Industrial) 
Building use: 
    Residential: Single Dwelling or Multifamily
    Commercial: Office, Restaurant, Retail
    Industrial: Heavy or Light Industry
As well as Interior square footage, Type of finishes desired: (Basic, Standard, High-end), and if the user would like to accelerate the timeline from 12 months to 9 months). 

Using the RS Means book as well as other sources listed below, the values per square foot of each building type are programmed to calculate the cost of the building by useing the square footage. This program considers the percentage of squrare foot cost that is needed to go towards labor, materials, and Contractor Fees. The final results are displayed in a table which shows the high end range and low end range of for the Cost of Materials, Labor, Contractor Fees, and the Total Cost. The user inputs are then briefly summarized towards the end of this program.
